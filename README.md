# Instagram-Login-web-page-clone
Using HTML and CSS I created a Clone for login page without using bootstrap libraries. 
# Link for the Webpage
https://nithinsaichoudary.github.io/Instagram_clone/

#Explanation

It contains a form for users to enter their login credentials (username and password) and a "Login" button. Additionally, there is an option for users to log in with their Facebook account, and links to reset their password or sign up for a new account. There are also images and links to download the Instagram app from Google Play and the Microsoft Store.

The CSS code is defining the style for the first div element with class "ldp1", which is a box with a border, specific dimensions, and positioned on the right side of the page.
